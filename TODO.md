### IDEAS

stack example, linked through database, so anyone can see the state of hte stack.
will persist over time.


db wrapper, will handle login info from config file, but takes databse name / table in class init/ static start
will create database if doesnt exist, can have templates to follow, users etc

Read stylesheet and inline into the page below head. only insert lines that have text.
