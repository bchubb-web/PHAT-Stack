# phntm
A lightweight framework designed to feel like magic; handling the boring bits of a modern web application, as if something (or someone) is doing it for you.

## Installation

To install require the package to your project

## Routing

Phntm uses a Namespace based router, similar to filesystem based routing from frameworks like NextJS
Routes are declared using directories and files, similar to NextJS' app router, but with a vanilla PHP twist.

The \Pages namespace is used to serve routes, declare the directory you want to use in your composer.json,
